# TGVIO Player Web

R2-19C Vite/TypeScript frontend. In normal builds it uses the authenticated,
same-origin Player API only:

- `GET /api/v1/feed`
- `GET /api/v1/media/:id`
- `PUT` / `DELETE /api/v1/media/:id/favorite`

The browser receives opaque media IDs and relative stream URLs only. It never
handles WebDAV URLs, filesystem paths, credentials, or access secrets.

Run locally after installing frontend dependencies:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

The API uses the authenticated Player session cookie. Sign in through the Player
login endpoint before opening the feed.

On a new installation, open Player settings and configure the writable WebDAV
destination for favorites. Until then the settings page shows “尚未配置收藏存储”;
favorites remain in Player SQLite and failed backups can be retried after setup.
The `.invalid` example endpoint is intentionally unreachable.

For isolated visual development only, start Vite with an explicit mock flag:

```sh
VITE_PLAYER_MOCK=true npm run dev
```

Without that exact flag, failed API requests show an error state; they never fall
back to mock media. There are always exactly three `<video>` elements: previous,
current, and next. Metadata lookahead and startup-range warm-up stay bounded by
the existing preload coordinator.

### Playback diagnostics

Each home-feed batch gets an opaque playback session ID. Video stream requests,
preload requests, and frontend playback events carry that ID so one playback
can be separated from older sessions. To inspect only recent Player events on
the VPS, start with a short time window:

```sh
docker logs --since 15m tgvio-player 2>&1 | grep 'player_event'
```

After finding a `session` value in a `frontend_playback` event, filter the
timeline to that session:

```sh
docker logs --since 15m tgvio-player 2>&1 | grep 'player_event' | grep '"session":"<session-id>"'
```

`http_request` events distinguish `video` streams from `preload` traffic and
classify outcomes such as `not_found`, `capacity_limited`, `server_error`,
`client_disconnected`, and `stream_ok`. `frontend_playback` events report
confirmed playback, media errors, probe status, retries, and skipped clips.
The media value is a stable fingerprint rather than the raw catalog ID.
